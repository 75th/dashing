# Examples

You can start with these simple examples and go from there.

## BusyBox

BusyBox is an embedded linux tool that provides many frequently used
shell commands.

This example is fairly complete, including an icon.

```
$ cd busybox
$ wget http://www.busybox.net/downloads/BusyBox.html
$ dashing build
```

## Dockerfile

This example builds documentation for Docker Dockerfiles. The CSS
selectors are just slightly more complicated, but nothing to cause
heartburn.

This example illustrates the usage of `ignore` fields.

```
$ cd dockderfile
$ wget https://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/`
$ dashing build
```
